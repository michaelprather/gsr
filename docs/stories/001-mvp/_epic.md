# MVP

Mobile-first, offline-capable scorekeeper for George Street Rummy. One device, one active game, local persistence, no internet required.

## Goals

- Replace paper scorekeeping with a faster, clearer digital experience
- Support the full 7-round game structure with proper validation
- Work offline with data that survives browser refresh
- Simple, monochrome wireframe styling

## Out of Scope

- Multi-device sync
- Cloud storage
- User accounts
- Game history
- Animations and visual polish (see Epic 002)
